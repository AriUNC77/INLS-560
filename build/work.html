            <h1>Work</h1>
            <p>My first job was doing data entry at the Orange County Animal Services
                Center. After that I worked as a part-time Harris Teeter Cashier.</p>

            <p>When I began going to SILS, I started trying to get jobs that related
                to the archiving and library science fields. I was able to get a good job
                at PBS-TV and do a field experience at Wilson Library, but I am still available
                for any new positions.
